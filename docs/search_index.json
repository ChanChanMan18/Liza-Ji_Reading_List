Introduction Hello! This website was made for the Liza/Ji research group. It will primarily serve as a collection of works to help new students navigate the literature and get up to speed on the workings of the group. In each of the panels to the side, you will see a different topic. For each of these chapters, you will find a selection of works coupled with a brief snippet describing the significance of the paper and how it may pertain to the work of new students. We also try here to supply a narrative describing how each of the works fit into a larger picture. If you have questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to Ji, Liza, or another member of the group. If you find anything on this website broken or lacking for any reason, don’t hesitate to contact Chandler (chandle at umich dot edu). Have fun exploring!

Something about latent space modeling here The Basics 1.0.1 Hoff et al You should begin by reading the seminal work Latent Space Approaches to Social Network Analysis Hoff, Raftery, and Handcock (2002) here. This paper views models networks as the ties (edges) between individuals (nodes). In particular, the paper presents a model wherein the probability of a tie between individuals depends on the positions of individuals in some unobserved “social space”. This social space corresponds to the latent space described above. In particular, the paper presents a distance model and a projection model based on these principles and shows how to fit these models using Procrustes analysis and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (don’t worry too much about this last part, just try to understand as many details as possible). 1.0.2 Some other paper here 1.1 Next Steps 1.1.1 Arroyo et al, COSIE 1.1.2 MacDonald et al, MultiNeSS 1.2 References Hoff, Peter D, Adrian E Raftery, and Mark S Handcock. 2002. “Latent Space Approaches to Social Network Analysis.” Journal of the American Statistical Association 97 (460): 1090–98. https://doi.org/10.1198/016214502388618906.

Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter).

Like this one 1. 4.2 Citations Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using @key. For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2025) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key. The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations References Xie, Yihui. 2015.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 6.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
