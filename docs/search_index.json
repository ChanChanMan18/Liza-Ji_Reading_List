Introduction Hello! This website was made for the Liza/Ji research group. It will primarily serve as a collection of works to help new students navigate the literature and get up to speed on the workings of the group. In each of the panels to the side, you will see a different topic. For each of these chapters, you will find a selection of works coupled with a brief snippet describing the significance of the paper and how it may pertain to the work of new students. We also try here to supply a narrative describing how each of the works fit into a larger picture. If you have questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to Ji, Liza, or another member of the group. If you find anything on this website broken or lacking for any reason, don’t hesitate to contact Chandler (chandle at umich dot edu). Have fun exploring!

The Basics Latent Space Modeling with Multiplex Networks", " Latent Space Modeling What is it? The Basics Hoff et al You should begin by reading the seminal work Latent Space Approaches to Social Network Analysis Hoff, Raftery, and Handcock (2002) here. This paper views models networks as the ties (edges) between individuals (nodes). In particular, the paper presents a model wherein the probability of a tie between individuals depends on the positions of individuals in some unobserved “social space”. This social space corresponds to the latent space described above. In particular, the paper presents the distance model \\[\\eta_{ij} = \\text{log odds}(y_{ij} = 1 | z_i, z_j, x_{ij}, \\alpha, \\beta) = \\alpha + \\beta&#39;x_{ij} - |z_i - z_j| \\] and a projection model \\[\\eta_{ij} = \\text{log odds}(y_{ij} = 1 | z_i, z_j, x_{ij}, \\alpha, \\beta) = \\alpha + \\beta&#39; x_{ij} + \\frac{z_i&#39; z_j}{|z_j|},\\] where the \\(x_{ij}\\) correspond to covariates and the \\(z_i\\) correspond to the positions of the nodes in the latent space. These models are then fit using Procrustes analysis and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (don’t worry too much about this last part, just try to understand as many details as possible). The Stochastic Block Model (Holland et al) Another foundational notion is the Stochastic Block Model. The first paper on the subject is Stochastic Blockmodels: First Steps Holland, Laskey, and Leinhardt (1983) here. The fundamental notion of the stochastic block model is very simple. You begin with a graph with \\(n\\) vertices. Partition these vertices into \\(r\\) communities (we might call these \\(C_1, \\dots, C_r\\)). Then, for any two vertices \\(u\\in C_i\\) and \\(v\\in C_j\\), the two are connected by an edge with probability \\(P_{ij}\\). Notice that the probability of connection is dependent only on the community assignment. Doing this for all vertices, we can build a symmetric \\(r\\times r\\) matrix \\(P\\) of edge probabilities. When \\(P_{ij} = p\\) for all \\(i, j\\), then the result is the famous Erdos-Renyi model. Random Dot Product Graphs (Athreya et al) Another foundational paper is Statistical Inference on Random Dot Product Graphs: a Survey Athreya et al. (2017) here. As in Hoff, in the Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG), the latent position vectors are drawn from some common distribution \\(F\\). In particular, we might have \\(\\mathbf{x}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{x}_n \\overset{\\text{iid}}{\\sim} F\\). That is, we have a graph with \\(n\\) nodes, each of which is associated with a position in the latent space. We then collect these rows and put them into a matrix \\(\\mathbf{X} = [\\mathbf{x}_1, \\mathbf{x}_2, \\dots, \\mathbf{x}_n]^{\\top} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}\\). Then the adjacency matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is modeled by \\[\\text{Prob}[\\mathbf{A} | \\mathbf{X}] = \\prod_{i &lt; j} (\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\top}\\mathbf{x}_j)^{A_{ij}}(1 - \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\top}\\mathbf{x}_j)^{1 - A_{ij}}\\] In this case, we write \\((\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{X}) \\sim \\text{RDPG}(F, n)\\).

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2025) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key. The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations References Xie, Yihui. 2015.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 5.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
