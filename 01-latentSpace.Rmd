# Latent Space Modeling {-}

## What is it? {-}



## The Basics {-}

### Hoff et al {-}

You should begin by reading the seminal work *Latent Space Approaches to Social Network Analysis* @Hoff01122002 <a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~brian/905-2009/all-papers/hoff-raftery-handcock-2002-jasa.pdf">here</a>.

This paper views models networks as the ties (edges) between individuals (nodes). In particular, the paper presents a model wherein the probability of a tie between individuals depends on the positions of individuals in some unobserved "social space". This social space corresponds to the latent space described above. In particular, the paper presents the distance model 

$$\eta_{ij} = \text{log odds}(y_{ij} = 1 | z_i, z_j, x_{ij}, \alpha, \beta) = \alpha + \beta'x_{ij} - |z_i - z_j| $$

and a projection model 

$$\eta_{ij} = \text{log odds}(y_{ij} = 1 | z_i, z_j, x_{ij}, \alpha, \beta) = \alpha + \beta' x_{ij} + \frac{z_i' z_j}{|z_j|},$$

where the $x_{ij}$ correspond to covariates and the $z_i$ correspond to the positions of the nodes in the latent space.

These models are then fit using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_Procrustes_problem">Procrustes analysis</a> and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (don't worry too much about this last part, just try to understand as many details as possible).


### The Stochastic Block Model (Holland et al) {-}

Another foundational notion is the **Stochastic Block Model**. The first paper on the subject is *Stochastic Blockmodels: First Steps* @holland1983stochastic <a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~brian/780/bibliography/04%20Blockmodels/Holland%20-%201983%20-%20Stochastic%20blockmodels,%20first%20steps.pdf">here</a>.

The fundamental notion of the stochastic block model is very simple. You begin with a graph with $n$ vertices. Partition these vertices into $r$ communities (we might call these $C_1, \dots, C_r$). Then, for any two vertices $u\in C_i$ and $v\in C_j$, the two are connected by an edge with probability $P_{ij}$. Notice that the probability of connection is dependent *only* on the community assignment. Doing this for all vertices, we can build a symmetric $r\times r$ matrix $P$ of edge probabilities. When $P_{ij} = p$ for all $i, j$, then the result is the famous <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93R%C3%A9nyi_model">Erdos-Renyi model</a>.



### Random Dot Product Graphs (Athreya et al) {-}

Another foundational paper is *Statistical Inference on Random Dot Product Graphs: a Survey* @athreya2017statisticalinferencerandomdot <a href="https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume18/17-448/17-448.pdf">here</a>.

As in Hoff, in the Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG), the latent position vectors are drawn from some common distribution $F$. In particular, we might have $\mathbf{x}_1, \dots, \mathbf{x}_n \overset{\text{iid}}{\sim} F$. That is, we have a graph with $n$ nodes, each of which is associated with a position in the latent space. We then collect these rows and put them into a matrix $\mathbf{X} = [\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \dots, \mathbf{x}_n]^{\top} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$. Then the adjacency matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is modeled by

$$\text{Prob}[\mathbf{A} | \mathbf{X}] = \prod_{i < j} (\mathbf{x}_i^{\top}\mathbf{x}_j)^{A_{ij}}(1 - \mathbf{x}_i^{\top}\mathbf{x}_j)^{1 - A_{ij}}$$

In this case, we write $(\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{X}) \sim \text{RDPG}(F, n)$.
