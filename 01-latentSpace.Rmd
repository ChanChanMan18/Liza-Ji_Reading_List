# Latent Space Modeling

## What is it? {-}

Something about latent space modeling here

## The Basics {-}

### Hoff et al

You should begin by reading the seminal work *Latent Space Approaches to Social Network Analysis* @Hoff01122002 <a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~brian/905-2009/all-papers/hoff-raftery-handcock-2002-jasa.pdf">here</a>.

This paper views models networks as the ties (edges) between individuals (nodes). In particular, the paper presents a model wherein the probability of a tie between individuals depends on the positions of individuals in some unobserved "social space". This social space corresponds to the latent space described above. In particular, the paper presents a distance model and a projection model based on these principles and shows how to fit these models using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_Procrustes_problem">Procrustes analysis</a> and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (don't worry too much about this last part, just try to understand as many details as possible).
